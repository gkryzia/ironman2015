## IRONMAN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS HAWAII 2015 - Data Analysis
#### Author: Grzegorz Kryzia
Individual project made as a part of the course Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization, UCLA Extension (11/2020)

## Description

In my project, based on the results of Ironman World Championships Hawaii 2015. Rather than answer one particular question I was trying to answer a few questions related to ironman competition. My questions were:    

* How age and gender impact overall time and times of individual disciplines?
* Which age group among each gender are the most competitive?
* Do older athletes always have the longer time to complete the race?
* What age groups are most numerous?
* How does time of one discipline impact an overall time?

The dataset description as well as all the calculations, visualisations, insights and observations are included in
